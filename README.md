### Hi there 👋

I’ve worked in the tech industry for 6 years, almost 5 of those writing code (mostly front-end/client-side JavaScript - React, Typescript, GraphQL(Apollo), Jest, React Testing Library, Styled Components but I’ve also done backend work in Node and a little bit of PHP and Python).

I love working on multidisciplinary teams that foster trust, empathy and transparency to build products that people love. And you can't have that without accessibility so I’ve dived deep into this field - I have my [CPACC certification from the IAAP](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional) and have given several talks about building with accessibility in mind. [I also teach a web accessibility course](https://platzi.com/cursos/accesibilidad-web/) on Latin America’s largest online learning platform 😁
